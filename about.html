    <H2>Favourite quotes</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leave it better than you found it</li>
        <li>Treat every day like it's your first day on the job. This helps remove the frustration of slow progress or decisions that didn't go my way. I was hired to fix a problem, that hasn't changed, so get to work, Leash!</li>
        <li>Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.</li>
        <li>What can I do to help?</li>
        <li>It's a dumpster fire, but I know it's a dumpster fire. Managing expectation is easy and helps me get to the solution quicker.</li>
        <li>Why was this implemented/decided etc. Knowing what decisions are being made and why helps to avoid doing the same thing over and over, and to identify other ways of fixing an issue.</li>
